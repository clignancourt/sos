<p>
Stéphane Miroux is a man whose vivid dreams and imagination often interfere with his ability to interact with</br> reality. He is coaxed back to his childhood home after his divorced father passes away and his mother,</br> Christine, finds him a job in a calendar printing company in France. His mother implies the position is a</br> creative role, and he prepares colourful drawings, each showing a disaster, for his "disasterology" calendar.</br> However, nobody appreciates his talents and it transpires that his mother had led him on - the real vacancy is</br> for nothing more than mundane typesetting work. While leaving his apartment to go to work one day, Stéphane</br> injures his hand helping his new neighbor move a piano into her apartment. The new neighbor, Stéphanie, invites</br> Stéphane into her apartment (unaware that he lives next door) where her friend Zoé tends to his wound. Stéphane</br> initially forms an attraction to Zoé, though he suspects it is instead Stéphanie who likes him.</p>
<p>
Stéphane realizes that Stéphanie, like him, is creative and artistic. They plan a project for use in a short</br> animated film. Following the advice of Guy, Stéphane's sex-obsessed co-worker, Stéphane pretends that he isn't</br> Stéphanie's neighbor, pretending to leave the building when he leaves her apartment. That night, when he is</br> sleepwalking he writes a confusing note to Stéphanie that asks for Zoé's phone number. Stéphane realizes his</br> mistake upon waking and retrieves the letter with a coat hanger, unaware that Stéphanie has already read it.</p>
<p>
Surrealistic and naturalistic elements begin to overlap, and the viewer is often uncertain of which portions</br> constitute reality and which are merely dreams. One such sequence, in which Stéphane dreams his hands become</br> absurdly giant, was inspired by a recurring nightmare director Michel Gondry had as a child.[5] As this line</br> gradually becomes more blurred, Stéphane becomes more enamoured with Stéphanie the more he spends time with her</br> and shares his many inventions with her, such as the "one-second time machine," a device that can go either</br> forward or backward in time by only one second. Stéphane's dreams encroach on his waking life as he tries to</br> win Stéphanie's heart and misses time at work. He breaks into her apartment, taking her stuffed toy horse, and</br> implants a mechanism inside of it that will make it gallop. While putting it back into her apartment, Stéphanie</br> arrives and catches him, demanding he leaves and becoming more upset with him. Embarrassed and heartbroken,</br> Stéphane retreats to his own apartment where he receives a call from Stéphanie, who apologizes and thanks him</br> for the gift she discovers: a galloping version of "Golden the Pony Boy," who she reveals was named after</br> Stéphane.</p>
<p>
As the months go by, waking and dreaming become even more intermixed. To Stéphane's surprise, the calendar</br> manufacturer accepts his "Disastrology" idea and it becomes a great success. A party is thrown in his honour,</br> but he becomes depressed and begins drinking excessively after he witnesses Stéphanie dancing flirtatiously</br> with another man. The next day, Stéphane and Stéphanie have a confrontation in their hallway when Stéphane</br> announces that he doesn't want to be Stéphanie's friend any longer. Stéphanie becomes very upset, offering</br> Zoé's phone number and reciting Stéphane's note. Stéphane, still unaware that Stéphanie has read the note,</br> assumes that they are connected through "Parallel Synchronized Randomness", a rare phenomenon he has examined</br> in his dreams. Stéphanie offers that they discuss their issues on a date, but on Stéphane's walk to the café to</br> meet her, he has a frightful vision that she isn't there and she doesn't love him after all. He runs back to</br> her apartment and bangs on her door, demanding that she stop torturing him; in actuality, she is indeed waiting</br> for him at the café. Stéphane runs at her door, attempting to break it down, but winds up bashing his head and</br> collapsing in the hall, where his mother eventually finds him bleeding. Tired of waiting, Stéphanie returns</br> home while Stéphane, coaxed by his mother and her friend, decides to move back to Mexico.</p>
<p>
Before leaving, Stéphane's mother insists that he say goodbye to Stéphanie. In his attempt to do so, he becomes</br> extremely crass, making sexual and offensive jokes to her, and accusing her of never being able to finish</br> something she starts. However, he reveals that he is truly interested in her because she's different from other</br> people. As his antagonistic behavior pushes her to her breaking point, Stéphanie asks Stéphane to leave but he</br> instead climbs into her bed and yells at her, before spotting two items on her bedside: his one-second time</br> machine, and the finished boat they had planned to use in their animated film. Stéphane falls asleep in</br> Stéphanie's bed. As she checks on him to see why he has become so quiet, she gently strokes his hair. The film</br> closes with Stéphane and Stéphanie riding Golden the Pony Boy across a field before sailing off into the</br> ocean's horizon in her white boat.</p>
