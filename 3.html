<h3>Dreaming. what else? (emymye4 - December 2006)</h3>
  it's funny to read how many people seem to be upset after having seen the film, </br>
  because he was so boring for them, nearly without sense or any real plot. </br>
  But what do you want of a film called "The science of dreams" (in original)? </br>
  Have you ever had a dream, which really had a defined structure or </br>
  felt like being the normal story of a normal day? </br>
  After my opinion the film was great, simply copying the "structure" of a fantastic dream. </br>
  Of course, after some minutes you won't find your way out of this chaos anymore. </br>
  But that's the way it should be. </br>
  Simply sitting in the cinema and no longer being able to realize, </br>
  if you are still watching the film or if you have lost yourself in your own dreams. </br>
  So to say, only a film for people living in two worlds, the real one and the magical one of dreaming.</br></br></br>

<h3>One of the most original films I've ever seen (kurciasbezdalas - 27 October 2008)</h3>
When I was watching this film at the beginning I thought that this is one of those movies </br>
which just trying to be weird to attract some audience. Actually this is a very original film. </br>
Even if you don't understand everything what's going on in this movie you are still fascinated </br>
by beautiful visuals. Actually there isn't much to understand. </br>
This film is about a guy who can hardly separate a fantasy from reality. </br>
It's also a love story between two people who are very different from others </br>
but they both are very creative and artistic and that makes them very suitable one for each other. </br>
But because of a guy's psychical problems it's still hard for them to relate. </br>
It's sometimes sad, sometimes funny but always interesting. The dreams of a main hero are portrayed </br>
so realistic that you always easily understand what he thinks and what he feels. </br>
Althou some people may not like it and don't understand it because it's pretty different film. </br>
But if you like films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which was made by Michel Gondry) </br>
than you'll probably like this one.</br></br></br></br>
